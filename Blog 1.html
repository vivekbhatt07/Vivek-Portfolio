        <h1>Profiling CSS for fun and profit</h1>
        <p>I’ve been recently working on optimizing performance of a so-called one-page web app. The application was highly dynamic, interactive, and was heavily stuffed with new CSS3 goodness. I’m not talking just border-radius and gradients. It was a full stack of shadows, gradients, transforms, sprinkled with transitions, smooth half-transparent colors, clever pseudo-element -based CSS tricks, and experimental CSS features.

            Aside from looking into bottlenecks on Javascript/DOM side, I decided to step into the CSS land. I wanted to see the kind of impact these nice UI elements have on performance. The old version of the app — the one without all the fluff — was much snappier, even though the JS logic behind it hasn’t changed all that drastically. I could see by scrolling and animations that things are just not as quick as they should be.</p>
